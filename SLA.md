## Scope

This SLA covers the ResponsibleAI Governance Platform API and Governance Dashboard
when self-hosted by the customer on infrastructure they control.

| **Professional** | 99.5% monthly | Pre-production model evaluation gates |
| **Enterprise** | 99.9% monthly | Production inference guardrails, compliance logging |

Uptime is measured as `(total_minutes - downtime_minutes) / total_minutes × 100`.
Scheduled maintenance windows (max 4 hours/month, announced 48h in advance) are excluded.
